This Lambda project utilizes:
- Use of pre-defined FunctionalInterface
- Use of method references in lambda expression
- Create own FunctionalInterface
- Create helper interface
- Methods Java8 Stream API (Terminal and Non-Terminal Operation)

Trying to achieve in project:
- Grasp and fully understand how to implement Lambda Expression
- Grasp and fully understand method reference in replace for lambda expression for readability and code reuse
- Lambda Expression also use for data extraction
- implement Predicate: test()
- implement Function: apply()
- implement Consumer: accept()
- implement Supplier: get()
- Basic use of Lambda Expression methods:
    - Predicate: and(), negate(), or()
    - Consumer: andThen()
    - Function: andThen, compose()
